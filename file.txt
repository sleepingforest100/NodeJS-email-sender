We are all surrounded by technology from all corners. From waking up in the morning till we sleep, in some way or the other, we need technology. Technology, our new present and future, is making human lives easier and more convenient. With new technological innovations, human beings have become more dependent on science and technology. We rely on technology for all our activities, and have become an integral part of our lives. The entire civilization has become reliant on the modern technology it employs. Life and business would come to a halt without technology. It is beneficial to society, but it must be handled cautiously. It is helpful, and at the same time, it is harmful. It has reduced manâ€™s labour and improved the productivity of the work, but it has also reduced employment at the same time. So, technology should be used only to a certain extent by not depending on it completely.
